# Find-a-Walking-Path
Used Google Maps apis to create a route simulator.

The user inputs their current location, desired destination, and distance they wish the travel. A valid travel route of the requested distance (with a small uncertainty) is returned in the form of directions. A rough visualization of the route is also given.

Gmplot, Google Maps Apis, and rearrangement of the harversine formula were needed in order to complete this task.
